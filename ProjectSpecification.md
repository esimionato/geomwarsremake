# Introduction #

This document explain what is this project and the reason for it. The subject that we will discuss is the creation of video game in Java.

# What are we doing? #

The game we are trying to make is Geometry Wars of Bizarre Creation. To be more precise it will be the first version of Geometry Wars evolve. We will try to make the game as complete as possible. That means that we will do all we can to make the graphics, the sounds, the gameplay and the user interface as great as possible.

# Why are we doing this? #

This project is primarly a learning project, so we expect to learn a lot of things by making it. One of the very important thing we want to learn is to be able to work in team. Being able to work in team is one of the most important thing if you want to be successful in making game. Still, this aspect is usually very neglected and underestimated. Working in a team is not as easy as it first seems and require a lot of communication.

We also expect to simply gain experience in making game by overcoming all the obstacles we might face in this project.

# Conclusion #

To conclude, we want to devellop our skills in game programming, work team, communication and graphics/sounds by making Geometry Wars.

Also, the experience we gain here will help us to make bigger game later.
